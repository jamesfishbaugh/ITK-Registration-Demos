# ITK-Registration-Demos

This repo contains 3 ITK registration demos: translation, affine, and BSpline registration. All registration demos are in 3D and take a fixed image, moving image, and output image name as arguments. 

There is example 3D brain MRI for running the demos in the `data` directory.
